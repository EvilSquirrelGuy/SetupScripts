# SetupScripts
Repository for my setup scripts for different OSes

## By OS
* [Windows](win_setup.ps1)

**DISCLAIMER**: _these scripts are mainly uploaded here so i can access them to make setting up OSes easier **for me**. if you want to use them, that's fine,
but it is your responsibility to review the script before running, if it fucks up your system, thats your own fault. i will not be accepting any pull requests
or issues. any sus options are only provided as proof-of-concept, and if used, they are used **at your own risk**. if you are reading this on a fork (i.e. not
EvilSquirrelGuy/SetupScripts), the scripts cannot be guaranteed to be free from malware. (worst thing this script does is install genshin without asking)_
